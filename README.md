# Autolog

_README generated with **Documatic**_.

Quickly generate changelogs
and release notes
by analysing your git history.
A python tool.
Format based on `KeepAChangelog`.

## Getting started

### Requirements

Minimum python 3.8.
Project actively supports python 3.8,
3.9,
3.10.
Clone the repository
and run `pip install -e .`
to package locally.

### Generate a Changelog

In a terminal,
run `autolog`
to create
a `CHANGELOG.md`
from your git commit history,
or update an existing changelog.
See [configuration](#configuration)
for information on how to configure
the changelog.

## Concepts

### Git commit parsing

The initial logic for generating a changelog
comes from reading
your git commit messages.
`autolog`
expects
commit messages to begin with an imperitive verb,
and to written passively.
`autolog` parses the message for signalling words
and phrases.

E.g. `Rename 'my_func' to 'my_awesome_func'`
will get interpreted as a "Changed" feature.
Whereas `'my_func' -> 'my_awesome_func'`
will not.

### Configuration

TODO.
